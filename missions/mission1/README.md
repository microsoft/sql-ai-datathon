# Mission 1: Creating Embeddings and Performing Search

You will be guided through implementing semantic search capabilities using embedding models and Azure SQL Database. In this mission, you will:

## Learning Objectives
- **Convert Text to Vectors**: Use an embedding model to convert text into high-dimensional vector representations
- **Store Embeddings**: Store embeddings efficiently in Azure SQL Database
- **Query with Vector Similarity**: Query the database using vector similarity to find semantically related content
- **Maintain Embeddings**: Keep embeddings updated as data changes

## Prerequisites
1. Azure SQL Database with populated data
1. Embedding model access (you can use the free AI Proxy to generate embeddings for free)

## Next Steps
After completing this mission, you will have implemented a semantic search solution that can find relevant information based on meaning rather than just keywords.
Proceed to [Mission 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../mission2/README.md) to learn how to build an end-to-end RAG pipeline that combines embeddings with language model generation.
