    "# Mission 3: Orchestrate SQL + AI workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This mission advances your skills by teaching you how to orchestrate complex workflows that combine SQL database operations with AI capabilities. You'll learn to build intelligent, multi-step processes that seamlessly integrate data retrieval, transformation, and AI-powered decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Learn how to design and implement sophisticated AI workflows that coordinate multiple database queries, embedding operations, and language model calls to solve complex business problems requiring multiple steps and decision points.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- **Build Multi-Step Workflows**: Create orchestrated processes that chain together SQL queries, vector searches, and AI model calls\n",
    "- **Implement Conditional Logic**: Use AI responses to determine next steps in your workflow\n",
    "- **Handle Data Transformations**: Process and prepare data between wor\n",
    "- **Manage State and Context**: Maintain information across multiple operations in a workflow\n",
