# SQL AI Datathon Starter Repository

Welcome to the SQL AI Datathon! You'll complete guided missions that will prepare you for building AI-powered applications with Microsoft SQL. You’ll use AI features to build embeddings, semantic/hybrid search, DAB endpoints, and an agent with RAG.

Complete all four missions to level up your skills, and add your own creative twist in the Open Hack to be eligible for judging for a ticket to [SQLCon 2026](https://techcon365.com/26sqlcon/)!

[Watch a live walkthrough of the missions on February 12th and 19th, 2026](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/S-1641/)

## Quick Start
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone, or open in Codespaces. 
3. Complete all missions, 1-4.
4. Learn how to submit an entry for the Open Hack project in [`open-hack.md`](open-hack.md).
5. Submit your project by **February 26 at 11:59 PM PT**

## Mission Briefs
1. [Embeddings & Search](missions/mission1/README.md) ([folder](missions/mission1))
2. [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](missions/mission2/README.md) ([folder](missions/mission2))
3. [Orchestrate SQL + AI workflows in C# or Python](missions/mission3/README.md) ([folder](missions/mission3))
4. [Building a Full-Stack AI Application in C# or Python](missions/mission4/README.md) ([folder](missions/mission4))
5. [Open Hack](open-hack.md)

## What you’ll build
- Embeddings & search 
- REST/GraphQL endpoints with Data API Builder
- An agent that answers questions grounded in your SQL data

## How you’re evaluated for the Open Hack
