# SQL AI Datathon Starter Repository

Welcome to the SQL AI Datathon! You'll complete guided missions that will prepare you for building AI-powered applications with Microsoft SQL. You’ll use AI features to build embeddings, semantic/hybrid search, DAB endpoints, and an agent with RAG.

Complete all four missions to earn a badge and unlock the Open Hack challenge.
You'll add your own creative twist in the Open Hack and be eligible for judging for a ticket to SQLCon 2026!
