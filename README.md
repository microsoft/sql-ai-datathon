# SQL AI Datathon Starter Repository

Welcome to the SQL AI Datathon! You'll complete guided missions that will prepare you for building AI-powered applications with Microsoft SQL. You’ll use AI features to build embeddings, semantic/hybrid search, DAB endpoints, and an agent with RAG.

Complete all four missions to level up your skills, and add your own creative twist in the Open Hack and be eligible for judging for a ticket to [SQLCon 2026](https://techcon365.com/26sqlcon/)!


## Quick Start
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone, or open in Codespaces. 
3. Complete the missions and repeat for Missions 2, 3, 4.
4. Learn how to submit an entry for the Open Hack project in [`open-hack.md`](open-hack.md).
